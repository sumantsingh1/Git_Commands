# Source Code Management Tool
## A source code management tool is essential for managing application code.
* Version Control: Tracks and records all changes, enabling rollbacks to previous versions when needed.
* Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work together simultaneously using features like branching and merging.
* Code Review: Facilitates peer review for code changes before merging into the main branch.
* Backup and Recovery: Acts as a central repository to store all versions, ensuring easy recovery after failures.
* Continuous Integration (CI): Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, builds, and deployments.
* Debugging: Helps trace and fix issues by comparing different versions of the code.
